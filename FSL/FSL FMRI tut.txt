1 STEP BET to skull strip your anatomical images

Skull stripping is necessary for more accurate co-registration and normalization (warping your images to a standardized space).


The preprocessing steps can be carried out in the FEAT GUI. To perform the preprocessing click on “Preprocessing” button. In the FEAT GUI, motion correction is specified in the “Pre-stats” tab.

FSL’s default is to not do slicetiming correction, and to include a temporal derivative instead.

In spatial smoothing, the signal of each voxel is averaged with the signal of its near voxels, weighted by a Gaussian kernel of some chosen full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is possible to set in FEAT GUI.


Co-registration and Normalization are packaged together as a single step in the FEAT GUI’s Registration tab

MELODIC ( Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components ) 3.0 uses Independent Component Analysis to decompose a single or multiple 4D data sets into different spatial and temporal components.
